# Redesign-of-Orbio-Earth-
Website UI/UX Case study

**Project Overview**

The project will be conducted as a single-man team. I will use a variety of research methods to get a well-rounded understanding of the users and their needs. I will also be resourceful and reach out to other UX professionals for advice and support. I will be patient and take my time to collect and analyze the data, and I will not be afraid to iterate on my designs based on my findings.

I believe that this project will be a valuable contribution to the Orbio Earth team. The findings of the UX research will help the team to improve the platform and make it more user-friendly. This will ultimately help energy industry professionals to track and reduce their methane emissions, which will have a positive impact on the environment.
